## Control flow:
Control flow is the direction in which a computer performs steps in a script. The control flow involves the demands and statements when the program is running. 

## Loops:

Loops are the repetition statements constantly running until the condition becomes false or there isn't anything else to loop. The "for loop" carries out a chunk of code only if the particular condition is proper. "While Loop" makes a loop that carries out a specific condition considering it evaluates to be true. "Do-while-loop" makes a loop that carries out a particular condition, considering it is false.

## JavaScript Function Syntax:
The javascript function is identified with "function," followed by a name and parentheses. Function names contain the same rules as variablesâ€”the parentheses include parameter names set apart by commas.
